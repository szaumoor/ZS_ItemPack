- Unenchanted shurikens are now available in the mod, redistributed across various shops in all games. They are available from +0 to +5.

## New Items

- Forge Fire (NWN): New war hammer +2 that deals extra fire damage, canonically (in NWN) made by Thalantyr. Guess where it will be sold in BGEE. It will exist in BG2EE too.
- Squire's Defense (NWN): Studded Leather Armor +2 that increases Strength by 1 and sets extraordinary strength to 100. Uses a recolored armor icon for now while a better one doesn't exist.
- Sseth's Revenge & Sseth's Fang (Elden Ring): A new short bow +2 that coats every arrow with mild poison, and has a special ammo that you can create with it that is much more powerful if shot from this bow specifically. A very special Yuan-Ti might have it. Carry some antidotes.

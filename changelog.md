## Modifications

- Light of the Calling's undead destroying effect now only affects liches 50% of the time, and demiliches are outright immune to it.
- Light of the Calling undead slay effect when powered up now has a custom death message.
- Several descriptions expanded and improved by [Llewren](https://github.com/Llewren). Thank you!

## New Items

- Forge Fire (NWN): New +2 warhammer that deals extra fire damage, canonically (in NWN) made by Thalantyr. Guess where it will be sold in BGEE. It will exist in BG2EE too.
- Squire's Defense (NWN): Studded Leather Armor +2 that increases Strength by 1 and sets extraordinary strength to 100
- Sseth's Revenge / Fang (Elden Ring): A new +2 shortbow that coats every arrow with mild poison, and has a special ammo that you can create with it that is much more powerful if shot from this bow specifically.
- Infernal Rapier +2 (Forbidden Game): A +2 rapier than grants a bonus to THAC0 and damage based on charisma and allows you to summon a friendly cambion.
- Sylvan Scimitar +1 (Forbidden Game): A +1 scimitar that grants extra THAC0 and damage to classes that around nature such as rangers and druids, and rewards specialized characters with extra bonuses. Two of these can be found, as they also have a mild dual wielding bonus.

# Changelog

## Modifications

- Light of the Calling's undead destroying effect now only affects liches 50% of the time, and demiliches are outright immune to it.
- Light of the Calling undead slay effect when powered up now has a custom death message.
- Several descriptions expanded and improved by [Llewren](https://github.com/Llewren). Thank you!

## New Items

- **NWN**
  - Forge Fire: New +2 warhammer that deals extra fire damage, canonically (in NWN) made by Thalantyr. Guess where it will be sold in BGEE. It will exist in BG2EE too.

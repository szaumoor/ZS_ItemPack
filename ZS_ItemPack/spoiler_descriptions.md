**Bloodthirst**

The Lord of Murder wasn't always a lord. He was once just a petty killer. When Bhaal first drew blood in a Baldurian back-alley, it dropped to the ground and lingered. When he ascended, this dried blood-drop grew, warped–and became sharp. Only those of dark hearts may use this blade.

**Crimson Mischief**

**Cold Snap**

In the steel of this dagger, small ice formations resembling bubbles in a bath shimmer with a chill. As you hold it, faint crackles echo in your ears, and the air around the weapon turns crisp and cold, with a faint mist clinging to its surface.

**Spell Siphon**

This dagger's blade is etched with shifting eldritch runes, which glow faintly whenever life is taken by its edge.

This finely crafted war hammer was designed as both a weapon of war and a tool of mercy.

**Deathstalker Mantle**

The Deathstalker Mantle
This blood-red cloak was once the sinister badge of honor bestowed upon Bhaal's most ruthless assassins. Forged in the name of the Lord of Murder, it served as a grim token of their unholy deeds.

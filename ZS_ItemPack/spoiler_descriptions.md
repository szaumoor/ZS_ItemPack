**Bloodthirst**

The Lord of Murder wasn't always a lord. He was once just a petty killer. When Bhaal first drew blood in a Baldurian back-alley, it dropped to the ground and lingered. When he ascended, this dried blood-drop grew, warped–and became sharp. Only those of dark hearts may use this blade.

**Cold Snap**

In the steel of this dagger, small ice formations resembling bubbles in a bath shimmer with a chill. As you hold it, faint crackles echo in your ears, and the air around the weapon turns crisp and cold, with a faint mist clinging to its surface.

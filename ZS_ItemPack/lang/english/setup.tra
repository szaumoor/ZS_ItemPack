@8019 = ~Goblinsplitter~
@8020 = ~This is a rough-hewn axe forged not with artistry, but with hatred. The name Goblinsplitter is crudely carved into the axe's head, and its pitted blade and battered handle bear the marks of countless battles against goblinoid foes. Over years of brutal use, the edge has become jagged and serrated, not by design but by repeated blows and makeshift repairs. Created by a blacksmith whose village was razed by marauding goblins, the weapon was designed with a single purpose: vengeance.

It was forged by an ancient sect of killers only known as the "Phantoms", where only those that proved their loyalty by committing a very challenging murder were granted the honor of wielding such a blade.

@12000 = ~Needle +1~
@12001 = ~This small and exceptionally slender rapier is designed for a wielder who values finesse over brute strength, with a design particularly suited for shorter races such as gnomes. Its steel blade tapers to a needle-sharp point, making it perfect for quick thrust attacks. Due to its unassuming size, many opponents dismiss it at first glance—an underestimation they regret moments later when they find themselves suddenly sporting a collection of small, bleeding wounds they hadn't planned for.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– +1 to Armor Class and saving throws (short races only)
– 3/2 attacks per round (2 attacks per round for short races)

@12010 = ~Craven Edge +4~
@12011 = ~This accursed blade once belonged to a vampire lord of ancient times. Infused with the essence of the Shadowfell, it possesses the power to drain the life force of its victims. Legends say the sword has a will and hunger of its own, and each wielder must struggle to restrain its appetite—or risk being consumed by its dark power and insatiable thirst for blood.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Each time the sword causes a bleeding wound or lands a critical hit, there is a 4% chance the wielder will enter a blood rage for 2 rounds. While in this state, the wielder is consumed by bloodlust, gaining +2 to damage and THAC0 but losing control, attacking both enemies and allies indiscriminately. Vampires are unaffected by this effect.

Combat abilities:
– Critical hits are 5% more likely and deal an additional 2d4+4 slashing damage
– Each hit drinks a small amount of the target's lifeblood, healing the wielder for 1 Hit Point. In addition, there is a 15% chance on hit to inflict a bleeding wound: the target takes 2d4 slashing damage per round for 3 rounds, and the wielder is healed for the same amount. The target may save vs. Death at -2 to take only half damage and heal the wielder for half as much. This effect does not work on vampires or creatures without blood.

The weapon's head is surrounded by jagged, blackened spikes, and those struck by the flail feel their hope draining away, and even the bravest may falter before its relentless onslaught.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Aura of Despair: all living enemies near the wielder suffer a -2 penalty to saving throws, reduced morale as if they were affected by the Curse spell, and a 10% chance per round to become panicked and slowed for 2 rounds if they fail a save vs. Spell

Combat abilities:
– 15% chance on hit for living targets to become crushed by hopelessness, suffering a -5 penalty to Armor Class and THAC0. This effect does not stack

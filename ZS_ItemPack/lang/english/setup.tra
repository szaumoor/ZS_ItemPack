@6000 = ~Sword of Dusk and Dawn +3~
@6001 = ~Sword of Dusk and Dawn +3
Rumored to have been forged by an ancient cult that attempted to unite the godly disciplines of the light and the dark, this exquisitely crafted longsword is a symbol of the eternal cycle between light and shadow and the never-ending struggle between light and shadow that governs the realms. Other folk link its creation to priests of Selune and Shar attempting to coax the deities into a truce, perhaps making this sword a symbol of this communion, while others claim that it represents the balance between evil and good, but none can confirm any such claims.

The blade itself shifts its appearance and powers with the rise and fall of the sun. During the night, the sword ignites with an inner fire, glowing faintly as if bathed in the final embers of the setting sun. With each strike, it delivers searing flames to its foes, a burning reminder to nocturnal creatures that they are not truly safe from the light and burn of the stars.

As the sun rises, the sword transforms, its fiery glow dimming as a cold, frosty aura begins to emanate from the blade. In the daylight hours, each swing deals cold damage, representing the inevitable approach of the chill of night. Even under the bright sun, the chill of twilight lurks, reminding all who face the sword that darkness will return, and none can escape its creeping grasp.

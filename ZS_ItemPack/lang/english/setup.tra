It is said to have been created by a rich illusionist, who was only known by the people around them as "The Illusive Man".

The blade was evolved six times, and now it is a truly legendary weapon. It may no longer be improved, as further attempts would likely require godlike power and there's no guarantee the weapon would be able to hold more power without catastrophic consequences.

It was forged by an ancient sect of killers only known as the "Phantoms", where only those that proved their loyalty by committing a very challenging murder were granted the honor of wielding such a blade. While many claim they were wiped out, and most indeed believe so, holding it carries the unsettling feeling that its masters may one day return to reclaim what is theirs.

@12000 = ~Needle +1~
@12001 = ~This small and exceptionally slender rapier is designed for a wielder who values finesse over brute strength, with a design particularly suited for shorter races such as gnomes. Its steel blade tapers to a needle-sharp point, making it perfect for quick thrust attacks. Due to its unassuming size, many opponents dismiss it at first glance—an underestimation they regret moments later when they find themselves suddenly sporting a collection of small, bleeding wounds they hadn't planned for.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– +1 to Armor Class and saving throws (short races only)
– 3/2 attacks per round (2 attacks per round for short races)

Combat abilities:
– 25% chance of inflicting a bleeding wound on hit, dealing 1d4 piercing damage instantly and then again after one round. No effect on creatures without blood

@12010 = ~Craven Edge +4~
@12011 = ~This accursed blade once belonged to a vampire lord of ancient times. Infused with the essence of the Shadowfell, it possesses the power to drain the life force of its victims. Legends say the sword has a will and hunger of its own, and each wielder must struggle to restrain its appetite—or risk being consumed by its dark power and insatiable thirst for blood.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Each time the sword causes a bleeding wound or lands a critical hit, there is a 4% chance the wielder will enter a blood rage for 2 rounds. While in this state, the wielder is consumed by bloodlust, gaining +2 to damage and THAC0 but losing control, attacking both enemies and allies indiscriminately. Vampires are unaffected by this effect.

Combat abilities:
– Critical hits are 5% more likely and deal an additional 2d4+4 slashing damage
– Each hit drinks a small amount of the target's lifeblood, healing the wielder for 1 Hit Point. In addition, there is a 15% chance on hit to inflict a bleeding wound: the target takes 2d4 slashing damage per round for 3 rounds, and the wielder is healed for the same amount. The target may save vs. Death at -2 to take only half damage and heal the wielder for half as much. This effect does not work on vampires or creatures without blood.

@6000 = ~Sword of Dusk and Dawn +3~
@6001 = ~Sword of Dusk and Dawn +3
Rumored to have been forged by an ancient cult that attempted to unite the godly disciplines of the light and the dark, this exquisitely crafted longsword is a symbol of the eternal cycle between light and shadow and the never-ending struggle between light and shadow that governs the realms. Other folk link its creation to priests of Selune and Shar attempting to coax the deities into a truce, perhaps making this sword a symbol of this communion, while others claim that it represents the balance between evil and good, but none can confirm any such claims.

The blade itself shifts its appearance and powers with the rise and fall of the sun. During the night, the sword ignites with an inner fire, glowing faintly as if bathed in the final embers of the setting sun. With each strike, it delivers searing flames to its foes, a burning reminder to nocturnal creatures that they are not truly safe from the light and burn of the stars.

As the sun rises, the sword transforms, its fiery glow dimming as a cold, frosty aura begins to emanate from the blade. In the daylight hours, each swing deals cold damage, representing the inevitable approach of the chill of night. Even under the bright sun, the chill of twilight lurks, reminding all who face the sword that darkness will return, and none can escape its creeping grasp.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– +25% resistance to fire and cold

Charge abilities:
– Earthly Reminder, two times per day
  Special: At night, spell acts as a Sunfire that blinds for 3 rounds and deals 8d6 fire damage plus 10 extra against the undead. During the day, it deals 8d6 cold damage and inflicts Slow for 3 rounds
  Area of effect: Every non-allied creature in a 15 ft. radius around the wielder

// tv-show inspired
@12000 = ~Needle +1~ // game of thrones
@12001 = ~This small and exceptionally slender rapier is designed for a wielder who values finesse over brute strength, with a design particularly suited for nimble fighters, especially shorter races such as dwarves, halflings, and gnomes. Its steel blade tapers to a needle-sharp point, making it perfect for quick thrust attacks. Due to its unassuming size, many opponents dismiss it at first glance—an underestimation they regret moments later when they find themselves suddenly sporting a collection of small, bleeding wounds they hadn't planned for.

STATISTICS:

– +1 to AC and all saving throws (dwarves, halflings, and gnomes)

@13000 = ~Ichor +2~
@13001 = ~This throwing dagger is no ordinary weapon. With a finely crafted, double-edged blade, it is designed for precision and lethality. Its compact handle offers perfect balance, making it a deadly tool in the hands of a skilled assassin. Coated with a potent, dark poison known only to the most feared killers, it is capable of bringing even the mightiest paladin to their knees. Rare and difficult to obtain, this dagger is the weapon of choice for those who seek to strike down even the most powerful foes from the shadows.

@13004 = ~Thunderclap +3~
@13005 = ~The Thunderclap is a dagger of strange and unpredictable power, its blade shimmering with the faintest crackle of arcane energy. Forged in forgotten times by a sect of storm-worshiping priests, this weapon is said to channel the fury of a divine tempest. One moment it is in your grasp, the next it seems to vanish, only to reappear with a deadly strike.

When the dagger is drawn, the air seems to hum with energy, and its edge leaves a faint echo of thunder in the wake of each strike. Though it is a simple weapon, its true strength lies in the storm it can summon—shocking enemies with the force of a distant storm's rage.

@13005 = ~Iceberg +4~
@13006 = ~This peculiar weapon is less a dagger than it is a solid mass of enchanted ice, its crystalline form resembling a jagged shard more than a finely crafted blade. The Icerberg is cold to the touch, exuding a supernatural chill that causes frost to form on the ground beneath it. When wielded by a strong hand, the icy blade hums with latent arcane power, its cold edge capable of rending flesh and bone with unnatural ease.

Though cumbersome for the weak, those who possess the strength to bear it will find that the Icerberg can be wielded with deadly precision. Upon striking, it releases a burst of freezing energy, capable of temporarily immobilizing foes and causing frostbite that lingers long after the blow is struck. In the hands of a truly powerful warrior, the Icerberg is as formidable as any sword, though its unusual nature makes it difficult to master.

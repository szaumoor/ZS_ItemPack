# RoyalProtector's Item Pack

This mod is a collection of items adapted from other games into the Infinity Engine. Not all items are ported with their original mechanics for several reasons:

- The Infinity Engine may not support certain mechanics from the original games.
- Some original effects are too generic or repetitive, so I avoid duplicating them across multiple items.
- Items that are spoilers or plot-critical in their original games may be reimagined, using only their likeness or inspiration to create new items.
- Adapting items to the Forgotten Realms setting sometimes requires changes to their mechanics, descriptions, or names. I aim to preserve the spirit of each item, but exact replication isn't always possible.
- Translating items into this universe may also require changes for lore consistency. For example, "Stygian Fury" is inspired by Elden Ring's "Rivers of Blood" katana, which references Mohg, the Lord of Blood. In this mod, the story is adapted to fit Orcus, a tangentially similar figure in the Forgotten Realms, resulting in conceptual and mechanical changes while maintaining the item's essence.

When you install a component that introduces a new weapon type (rapier, estoc, or kukri), the mod will also add generic versions of that weapon to various stores in the game. In BGEE, you can find up to +1 versions of these weapons for sale; in BG2EE, up to +3 versions will be available. If you prefer not to add these generic items, you can disable this feature in the configuration file.

<summary><b> Forbidden-game-inspired </b></summary>

These items are taken from a forbidden game that shall not be named. Due to plot critical reasons, a few items were changed in some degrees, retaining less from the original design, but it still aligns with the original design in some dimension.

**Component 101:** Add Everburn Blade +1

This component adds a new cool flaming +1 two-handed sword that is more powerful against demons, and also when wielded by tieflings. This item will be wielded by the Cambion in Irenicus' dungeon in BG2, and in BG1, it will be wielded Azothet's servants at the end of Dorn's questline (not lootable), and Simmeon himself, who will drop it but not use it.

**Component 102:** Add Bloodthirst +3

This component adds a new evil-only, Bhaal-inspired crimson twisted dagger that is more likely to critically hit and reduces the resistance to piercing damage on targets. Tamoko drops this item.

**Component 103:** Add Crimson Mischief +3

This component adds an evil-only short sword that deals more damage the more wounded the target is, and can occassionally (4% chance) reduce the HP of the target by 20%.

**Component 104:** Add Assassin's Touch +1

This component adds a new dagger that deals more damage to targets that are asleep, and allows thieves to use it more efficiently. Single-classed assassins get the most benefit out of it.

**Component 105:** Add Ritual Dagger

This component adds a new dagger that is not very accurate but deals a good amount of damage. It can be used to get beneficial effects if you're willing to pay the price.

**Component 106:** Add Cold Snap +1

This component adds a new dagger that deals varying amounts of extra cold damage and may very briefly snap freeze some targets if they fail their saves.

**Component 107:** Add Spell Siphon +1

This component adds a new dagger which allows wizards and sorcerers to recall level 1 spells when something is killed with the dagger. On rare occasions, it will also restore level 2 spells.

**Component 108:** Add Cruel Sting +1

This component adds a new long sword with a spider and poisonous theme which excels when hitting targets that are webbed or otherwise incapacitated.

**Component 109:** Add Judgment +4

This adds a new powerful warhammer that deals crushing and fire damage and increases defenses. It has the ability to switch to a non-lethal mode which frees allies (or anyone else) from paralysis, stun, and hold effects on hit.

**Component 110:** Add The Deathstalker Mantle

This adds a new cool cloak for assassins and other stabby-stabby characters. Upon killing an enemy, become immediately invisible and gain a +1 bonus to THAC0 and damage for 2 rounds. This effect can only trigger once per round.

## The new weapon types

These are the base characteristics of the new weapon types compared to others in the same group, and beyond unique traits:

- **Estoc**: Estocs are big thrusting swords that use the two-handed sword animation, inflicts piercing damage, requires 2 hands to use it, but uses the proficiency type of long sword. Damage-wise, they have a base damage of 1d8+1 and a base speed factor of 6, and they are innately allowed to critically hit 5% more often. Animation-wise, they do mostly poke animations.
- **Kukri**: Kukris are for all intents and purposes considered dagger, but they are one point slower as far as speed factor goes, but critically hit 5% more often.
- **Rapier**: Rapiers are small thrusting swords that use the short sword animation, inflict 1d6 piercing damage, use the short sword proficiency, and can critically hit 5% more often and use a base speed factor of 4. They use the piercing animation more often than the short sword.

## Compatibility and Installation order

This mod should be installed after all other mods that add new creatures to the game, and to be extra safe, after all mods that add new items to the game. Currently, though, it only matters when and if you install Cold Snap, due to a technical detail of how the item is implemented, specifically, it tries to find items that provide immunity to paralysis. If you're confident that's not a problem, you can install it any order with respect to other item packs.

It should be installed before mods that add new kits, as some kits (like my shadowdancer kit) will patch items in this pack, as well as any and all mods tweak packs that modify items.

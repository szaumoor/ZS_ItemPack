# RoyalProtector's Item Pack

This mod is a collection of items translated from other games into the IE engine. Some items from other games are not ported **functionally** exactly the same way for various reasons, including:

- The game doesn't support the mechanics of the originals
- The effects are too generic on various items originally and I don't want to repeat myself on multiple items
- The item involves a spoiler or is a plot-critical item. In those cases, I may use just the likeness of the item in the game, to create a new shiny item. For example, Orphic Hammer is one such case, which is instead in this item pack a Infernal Warhammer +3, which may be upgraded with demon hearts and maybe something else later on.
- The item's conversion into the Forgotten Realms setting necessitates a change in item's mechanics. I try to keep the spirit of the item, but sometimes it's not possible to keep the original mechanics.

As usual with my mods, every item is encapsulated in a different component, so you're not forced to include any item that you don't like for any reason.

## Forbidden-game-inspired

These items are taken from a forbidden game that shall not be named. Due to plot critical reasons, a few items were changed in some degrees, retaining less from the original design, but it still aligns with the original design in some dimension.

**Component 101:** Add Everburn Blade +1 (two-handed sword)

This component adds a new cool flaming two-handed sword that is more powerful when against demons, and also when wielded by tieflings. This item will be wielded by the Cambion in Irenicus' dungeon in BG2, and in BG1, it will be wielded by the final boss at Durlag's dungeon.

**Component 102:** Add Bloodthirst +3 (dagger)

This component adds a new evil-only, Bhaal-inspired crimson twisted dagger that is more likely to critically hit and reduces the resistance to piercing damage on targets. Tamoko drops this item.

**Component 103:** Add Crimson Mischief +3 (short sword)

This component adds a new evil-only short sword that deals more damage the less health the enemy has, as well as some extra magic and cold damage.

**Component 104:** Add Assassin's Touch +1 (dagger)
**Component 105:** Add Ritual Dagger (dagger)
**Component 106:** Add Cold Snap +1 (dagger)

**Component 107:** Add Spell Siphon +1 (dagger)
**Component 108:** Add Cruel Sting +1 (long sword)
**Component 109:** Add Archfiend's Judgment +3 (warhammer)

This adds a new powerful warhammer that deals crushing and fire damage and increases defenses. It has the ability to switch to a non-lethal mode which frees allies (or anyone else) from paralysis, stun, and hold effects on hit.

**Component 110:** Add The Deathstalker Mantle (cloak)

This adds a new cool cloak for assassins and other stabby-stabby characters. Upon killing an enemy, become immediately invisible and gain a +1 bonus to THAC0 and damage for 2 rounds. This effect can only trigger once per round.

## Souls inspired

**Component 200:** Add Sword of Dusk and Dawn +3 (long sword)

## Mass Effect inspired

## NWN/NWN2 inspired

**Component 507:** Add Blade of the Rashemi (two-handed sword)

This sword protects the wielder from magic, and causes 10% spell cast failure on hit for 5/2 rounds. Deals 1d12+1 damage, and acts as a +2 weapon if a berserker, barbarian, o Rashemi warrior is wielding it.

## TV/Film inspired

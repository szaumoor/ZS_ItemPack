# RoyalProtector's Item Pack

This mod is a collection of items translated from other games into the IE engine. Some items from other games are not ported **functionally** exactly the same way for various reasons, including:

- The game doesn't support the mechanics of the originals
- The effects are too generic on various items originally and I don't want to repeat myself on multiple items
- The item involves a spoiler or is a plot-critical item. In those cases, I may use just the likeness of the item in the game, to create a new shiny item based on it, or inspired by it to various degrees.
- The item's conversion into the Forgotten Realms setting necessitates a change in item's mechanics. including their description and names. I try to keep the spirit of the item, but sometimes it's not possible to keep the original mechanics.

As usual with my mods, every item is encapsulated in a different component, so you're not forced to include any item that you don't like for any reason.

<summary><b> Forbidden-game-inspired </b></summary>

These items are taken from a forbidden game that shall not be named. Due to plot critical reasons, a few items were changed in some degrees, retaining less from the original design, but it still aligns with the original design in some dimension.

**Component 101:** Add Everburn Blade +1 (two-handed sword)

This component adds a new cool flaming two-handed sword that is more powerful when against demons, and also when wielded by tieflings. This item will be wielded by the Cambion in Irenicus' dungeon in BG2, and in BG1, it will be wielded by the final boss at Durlag's dungeon.

Description:

Silent, somewhat translucent flames surge the length of the blade as soon as it clears the scabbard. This two handed sword is a common weapon for servants of fiends involved in the eternal Blood War. How it ended up here is anyone's guess.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– Demonic enemies have a penalty in the combat rolls against the wielder, as if protected by a Protection from Evil spell that only applies to them

Combat abilities:
– Affects demonic enemies immune to +2 weapons, and hits as a +2 weapon against them
– The fire damage dealt to demons cannot be resisted, even if they are immune to normal fire damage

THAC0: +1, +2 for Tieflings
Damage: 1d10+1 (+2 for Tieflings), +1d2 fire damage (1d3+1 if wielded by Tieflings)
Damage type: Slashing
Speed Factor: 8
Proficiency Type: Two-handed Sword
Type: Two-handed
Requires:
 14 Strength

Weight: 12

**Component 102:** Add Bloodthirst +3 (dagger)

This component adds a new evil-only, Bhaal-inspired crimson twisted dagger that is more likely to critically hit and reduces the resistance to piercing damage on targets. Tamoko drops this item.
Description:

The Lord of Murder wasn't always a lord. He was once just a petty killer. When Bhaal first drew blood in a Baldurian back-alley, it dropped to the ground and lingered. When he ascended, this dried blood-drop grew, warped–and became sharp. Only those of dark hearts may use this blade.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– AC: +1

**Component 103:** Add Crimson Mischief +3 (short sword)

This component adds a new evil-only short sword that deals more damage the less health the enemy has, as well as some extra magic and cold damage.
Description:

his blood-red short sword is a weapon born of pure evil and sadism. It causes more pain the weaker the target is, seemingly pushing itself more forcefully into the bodies of its victims, causing horrific damage. Because of this, only those with an unsavory moral compass may use it.

STATISTICS:

 – Between 85 and 100 HP: 1d2

– Target must save vs. Death at -2 or bleed for 4 rounds, suffering 1 point of piercing damage, and again once per round

**Component 106:** Add Cold Snap +1 (dagger)

Description:

In the steel of this dagger, small ice formations resembling bubbles in a bath shimmer with a chill. As you hold it, faint crackles echo in your ears, and the air around the weapon turns crisp and cold, with a faint mist clinging to its surface. The blade lives up to its name, delivering a sharp bite of frost with every strike, freezing the victims as swiftly as a sudden winter storm.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– +25% cold resistance

Combat abilities:
– 15% chance of dealing extra 1d8 cold damage
– 15% chance of snap-freezing the target on hit, paralyzing them for half a round if a save vs. Death at -2 is failed. Targets immune to cold damage and undead are immune to this effect

 3 Strength

**Component 107:** Add Spell Siphon +1 (dagger)

Description:

This dagger's blade is etched with shifting eldritch runes, which glow faintly whenever life is taken by its edge. The weapon seems to hunger for the energies of the slain, drawing their essence into its wielder's mind to restore their magical reserves. Only those who wield the arcane arts may use this weapon.

STATISTICS:

This adds a new powerful warhammer that deals crushing and fire damage and increases defenses. It has the ability to switch to a non-lethal mode which frees allies (or anyone else) from paralysis, stun, and hold effects on hit.

Description:

This finely crafted war hammer was designed as both a weapon of war and a tool of mercy. Said to have been wielded by a champion of a benevolent deity, it strikes with righteous force, toppling foes while breaking through ensnaring magic. The hammer's head glows with a steady inner heat that sears foes on touch–a reminder that justice can both punish and liberate.

STATISTICS:

Equipped abilities:
– +20% resistance to Fire and Magic
– +2 bonus to saving throws vs. all except Death

Combat abilities:
– 10% chance to knock the target prone, push them back for 1 round, and deal 2d4+2 crushing damage. The incapacitating effects do not work on giants, levitating creatures, or non-solid entities. Fiends are always affected.
– Can switch to a non-lethal mode, which deals no damage but frees any hit creature from paralysis, stun, hold, and other movement-limiting effects such as Grease or Web.

Description:

The Deathstalker Mantle
This blood-red cloak was once the sinister badge of honor bestowed upon Bhaal's most ruthless assassins. Forged in the name of the Lord of Murder, it served as a grim token of their unholy deeds. Etched along the hem these words can be read: "Let hill and hollow be a door to screams that last forevermore."

Equipped abilities:
– +5% critical hit chance while the user is invisible or hidden
– The Shadow Itself: Upon killing an enemy, the wearer becomes invisible for 2 rounds and gains a +1 bonus to damage and THAC0 during this time. This effect can only trigger once per round

## Compatibility and Installation order

This mod should be installed after all other mods that add new creatures to the game, and to be extra safe, after all mods that add new items to the game. Currently, though, it only matters when and if you install Cold Snap, due to a technical detail of how the item is implemented, specifically, it tries to find items that provide immunity to paralysis. If you're confident that's not a problem, you can install it any order with respect to other item packs.

It should be installed before mods that add new kits, as some kits (like my shadowdancer kit) will patch items in this pack, as well as any and all mods tweak packs that modify items.

## Credits
- To BeamDog and Bioware for the game, obviously.
- zenblack for providing icons for **LITERALLY every item in this mod**. All hail to his mighty icon-making skills.
- zenblack, dark0dave and others who have helped me with the modding process or by providing resources, as well as their creativity for some of the descriptions
- People on Discord generally for their help

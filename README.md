# RoyalProtector's Item Pack

This mod is a collection of items adapted or inspired from other games into the Infinity Engine. Not all items are ported with their original mechanics for several reasons:

- The Infinity Engine may not support certain mechanics from the original games.
- Some original effects are too generic or repetitive, so I avoid duplicating them across multiple items.
- Items that are spoilers or plot-critical in their original games may be reimagined, using only their likeness or inspiration to create new items.
- Adapting items to the Forgotten Realms setting sometimes requires changes to their mechanics, descriptions, or names. I aim to preserve the spirit of each item, but exact replication isn't always possible.
- Translating items into this universe may also require changes for lore consistency. For example, "Stygian Fury" is inspired by Elden Ring's "Rivers of Blood" katana, which references Mohg, the Lord of Blood. In this mod, the story is adapted to fit Orcus, a tangentially similar figure in the Forgotten Realms, resulting in conceptual and mechanical changes while maintaining the item's theme.

When you install a component that introduces a new weapon type (rapier, estoc, or kukri), the mod will also add generic versions of that weapon to various stores in the game. In BGEE, you can find up to +1 versions of these weapons for sale; in BG2EE, up to +3 versions will be available. If you prefer not to add these generic items, you can disable this feature in the configuration file.

If you want spoilers for item descriptions, you can find them in the translation files at ZS_ItemPack/lang. For spoilers about where to find the items, you can check the spoiler locations file at ZS_ItemPack/spoiler_locations.md.

## The new weapon types

These are the base characteristics of the new weapon types compared to others in the same group, and beyond unique traits:

- **Estoc**: Estocs are large, two-handed thrusting swords that use the two-handed sword animation. They deal 1d8+1 piercing damage, have a base speed factor of 6, and require both hands to wield. Estocs use the long sword proficiency and have an innate 5% higher chance to score a critical hit. Their attack animations primarily feature thrusting (poke) motions.
- **Kukri**: Kukris are for all intents and purposes considered daggers, but they are one point slower as far as speed factor goes, but critically hit 5% more often.
- **Rapier**: Rapiers are light, thrusting swords that use the short sword animation. They deal 1d6 piercing damage, have a base speed factor of 4, and use the short sword proficiency. Rapiers have a 5% higher chance to score a critical hit compared to standard short swords, and their attack animations emphasize thrusting motions.

## Compatibility and Installation order

This mod should be installed after all other mods that add new creatures to the game, and to be extra safe, after all mods that add new items to the game. Currently, though, it only matters when and if you install Cold Snap, due to a technical detail of how the item is implemented, specifically, it tries to find items that provide immunity to paralysis. If you're confident that's not a problem, you can install it any order with respect to other item packs.

It should be installed before mods that add new kits, as some kits (like my shadowdancer kit) will patch items in this pack, as well as any and all mods tweak packs that modify items.
